<p>
  I, Shawn Liu, am an award-winning father of two boys, living in Brooklyn NY USA. 
  Coffee is what I truly love (besides my family), and I try to convince myself
  <a href="https://doevery.day/mrshawnliu">every day</a> that I love drawing just as much.
</p>

<p>
  MRSHAWNLIU authors a zine called <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MRSHAWNLIU">Neophyte</a>.
  He likes to listen to <a href="{% link fun/favorite-albums.html %}">music</a> while he draws.
</p>

<p>
  For a couple hours a day, I also do some <a href="http://doevery.day">stuff</a> on the internet.
  In my previous life, I founded a business (<a href="https://www.getharvest.com">Harvest</a>) and got real lucky with it (grateful, astonished, never take it for granted, etc).
</p>

<p>
  Years ago my mother noticed that I like to take pictures of trash. She thought it was odd.
  I reminded her that I got my genes from her.
</p>

<p>
  You can find me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrshawnliu/">Instagram</a>.
  Call me sir, or mister, especially if you're younger than 18, ok? Glad we understand each other.
