  <h2>Thu Mar 16, 2022</h2>
  <p>
    My friend Barry and I made a little thing called
    <a href="https://doevery.day">doevery.day</a>.
    I want a calendar to track my drawing each day,
    so that I can see the streak I'm building––and 
    have that as a motivation to keep going
    (so I don't break the chain). 
    As of today I'm on a 32-day streak!
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as important as the streak, 
    I want <a href="https://doevery.day/mrshawnliu">my calendar</a> to be public 
    so my friends can see my progress and encourage me.
    Or maybe just <em>knowing</em> that
    someone might see my doevery.day page pushes
    me forward?
  </p>
  <p>
    doevery.day isn't for everyone. For those who don't care, here's an
    album recommendation: 
    <a href="https://heladonegro.bandcamp.com/album/far-in">Far In</a> by Helado Negro.
    And if that doesn't do it for you... perhaps 
    this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOsVpoe5tzY&t=34s">video</a> will?
  </p>
