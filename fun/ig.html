    <li>I'm hosting a <a href="https://creativemornings.com/talks/drawing-club">drawing club</a>
      on Oct 5!</li>
    <li>If you can't make it but want to draw with me, you can sign up for 
      Zoom Zoom Drawing Club's <a href="https://buttondown.email/mrshawnliu">mailing list</a>. 
      I'll try to run it weekly! I think! I'll try!</li>
    <li>East Coast art lovers: I recommend the 
      <a href="https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/ulala-imai-the-scene/">Ulala Imai exhibit</a> at KARMA. If you go there, don't forget to stop by their lovely <a href="https://bookstore.karmakarma.org">bookstore</a>, which is only a couple of blocks away.</li>

  <h2>Thu Mar 16, 2022</h2>
  <p>
    My friend Barry and I made a little thing called
    <a href="https://doevery.day">doevery.day</a>.
    I want a calendar to track my drawing each day,
    so that I can see the streak I'm building––and 
    have that as a motivation to keep going
    (so I don't break the chain). 
    As of today I'm on a 32-day streak!
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as important as the streak, 
    I want <a href="https://doevery.day/mrshawnliu">my calendar</a> to be public 
    so my friends can see my progress and encourage me.
    Or maybe just <em>knowing</em> that
    someone might see my doevery.day page pushes
    me forward?
  </p>
  <p>
    For those who don't care, here's an
    album recommendation: 
    <a href="https://heladonegro.bandcamp.com/album/far-in">Far In</a> by Helado Negro.
    And if that doesn't do it for you... perhaps 
    this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOsVpoe5tzY&t=34s">video</a> will?
