# April 18, 2023

Hello! Welcome to Zoom Zoom Drawing Club. As usual, feel free to draw whatever you want, however you please.

If youâ€™d like some prompts, Iâ€™ve prepared some photos I snapped during my stay in Taiwan (Iâ€™m here visiting my mom).

Please join me on the **[Zoom Zoom Drawing Club forum](https://ponder.us/join/394ba2b9)**! 
One common feedback I've received is that people would like to
talk further after each drawing session.
So, I've set up a private space for us to share work, ask questions, and discuss 
drawing-related topics. Hope to see you there!

See you next time! ðŸ˜„
