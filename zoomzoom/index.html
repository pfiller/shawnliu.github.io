<p>
  Zoom Zoom Drawing Club is for anyone who wants to draw with other people, over Zoom.
  It really is for anyone––you can be a beginner who needs a little bit of encouragement, or a seasoned artist who just wants some company, or someone in between who just wants to draw. All levels are welcomed!
